This analysis reviews charter and district high schools and their correlating students, grades, size, budgets, reading and math scores. 
First the data reviews the number of schools (15), the total students (39,170), their budgets, average math & reading scores, and their corresponding passing percentages and overall passing rates, this creates the district summary. 
Next there is a school summary that looks at whether a school is a district or charter, then calculates the number of students in each high school per the data. 
Then, it looks at the budget and capita based on the data, and breaks it down by math and reading. 
The passing rates are then turned into percentages and a summary made called per_school_summary. 
Next the performance rates are calculated for the schools highest and lowest respectively. 
After that the code looks at math and reading scores are calculated by grades and then the spending based on the scores. 
This creates the data for the spending summary. Next the data is formed around the school sizes, again based on the math and reading test scores, and student passing rate(s). 
This creates a size summary. Lastly the data is used to summarize the math and reading scores by school types (district or charter). 
One conclusion one could make from the data is that charter schools have a higher overall passing rate at 90%. 
Another conclusion from the data suggests that when a school is larger than 2,000 students the overall passing rate declines rapidly.
